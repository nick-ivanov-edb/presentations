This is the presentation from my talk at the PASS Data Community Summit 2003, 
entitled _Running PostgreSQL in a Kubernetes Cluster: CloudNativePG_.

Demos are implemented as Jupyter notebooks, where you can execute the commands
and see their output in real time, provided that all prerequisites are met:

- A functioning Kubernetes cluster.
- `kubectl` installed and configured to access that cluster.
- The `cnpg` plugin for `kubectl` installed.
